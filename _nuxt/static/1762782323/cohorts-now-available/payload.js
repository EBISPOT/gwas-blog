We share this list with the PGS Catalog, so you may find cohorts listed there that are not currently associated with a GWAS Catalog study.  It's important to remember we only extract cohorts when they have been clearly and unambiguously named by authors, so a cohort may have been used in other publications which don't have annotation.\nWhere a sample cohort in the literature was not already in the predefined list at the time of curation, or was ambiguously described, “other” will appear in our studies download file. Where a sample in the literature had no cohort reported, “NR” will appear in our studies download file. Consortium names are extracted if the component cohorts are not provided, or there are too many component cohorts to curate.  Empty cohort fields appear for studies curated before the pilot work to extract this information began (~2020).\nWe also accept submissions of unpublished data and these are listed in separate download files.
