These data are however valuable to Open Targets’ scientific goals of target identification and prioritisation, so much so they decided to invest in a new project aiming to expand the scope of the Catalog to include targeted arrays, such as MetaboChip, ImmunoChip, and Exome array. The new GWAS will now allow variants associated with immunologic, metabolic and oncologic phenotypes to be included in the Open Targets Platform for the expansion of target identification and selection in these traits."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:i,props:{id:u},children:[{type:b,tag:e,props:{href:"#selecting-and-curating-non-genome-wide-array-studies",ariaHidden:j,tabIndex:k},children:[{type:b,tag:l,props:{className:[m,n]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:v}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"As a first step, Open Targets selected almost 60 publications for inclusion in the GWAS Catalog.
