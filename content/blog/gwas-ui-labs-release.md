# New GWAS web search interface ready for testing

We are excited to announce the release of a new version of the GWAS Catalog web search interface, which is available for testing on our [labs site](www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/labs).

This is a guide to the main differences you will see.

The biggest change we have made is to increase the loading speed of pages, to account for recent increases in data volume and ensure we are robust for future growth. Check out a high-level query like “cancer” for maximum effect!

We’ve also changed the layout of the data pages, with tabs for the different data facets (i.e. associations, studies, visualisations), so you don’t need to scroll to find your data of interest:

Studies with full summary statistics available for download are now easier to find in their own tab:

Please try out the new site and let us know what you like, what you don’t like, if you find any bugs or if any of your favourite features are missing. You can send feedback via gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk or report bugs directly via [GitHub](https://github.com/EBISPOT/gwas-ui/issues)

Lastly, note that links to the GWAS Diagram have been disabled in the labs site. We are working on the next generation of the Diagram and will share this with you soon!
