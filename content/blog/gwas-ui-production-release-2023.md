# New GWAS web search interface

We are excited to announce the release of a new version of the GWAS Catalog web search interface. 

This is a guide to the main differences you will see.

The biggest change we have made is to increase the loading speed of pages, to account for recent increases in data volume and ensure we are robust for future growth. Check out a high-level query like “cancer” for maximum effect!

We’ve also changed the layout of the data pages, with tabs for the different data facets (i.e. associations, studies, visualisations), so you don’t need to scroll to find your data of interest:

Studies with full genomewide summary statistics available for download now have their own tab, making it easier to see when summary statistics are available:

Interested to find the study with the biggest sample size for your trait of interest? Just use the sort option on the sample number columnn:

Hope you enjoy using the new features! Please report any bugs to gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk or via [GitHub](https://github.com/EBISPOT/gwas-ui/issues)

Lastly, watch this space for the next generation of the GWAS Diagram - we're working on it!
